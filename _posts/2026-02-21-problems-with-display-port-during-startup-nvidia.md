title: "Problems with using Display Port on Nvidia hardware during system bootup"

So, I was diagnosing my computer recently and encountered some strange issues.

First was that if my system is warm rebooted (the power supply doesn't fully shut off), nothing would show up on the screen.

Not until I turn the power off completely and turn it back on. (Force shutdown by PSU and spamming power button to clear power).

It got really annoying to troubleshoot anything, right? but other times, it works as expected so its not very reliable.

Then I tried using HDMI, for reference my graphics device is the RTX 3080 Ti. it has a lot of DisplayPorts but only one HDMI.

And then things just work reliability, I can warm reboot all I want and the image will come up on the screen. unlike displayport.

Only downside is I can't fully utilize my monitor functions, such as 165hz. but now I know that HDMI is more reliable than displayport during system bootup.
