I learned the hard way that plasma TV's are not very good. It burns in too easily, temporary but still bothersome.

And if you go over 768 scanlines vertically, the image is quite blurry. I sold that TV now so I hope to get a flat panel.

The model of the TV was `ps43e450a1r`.

You can get a half decent picture by setting custom resolution of `1368x768`. but no device will output this natively so it's not very useful for anything else except the computer.

Plug in really anything else, even devices that can output `1280x720` with scale to center (i think this is equivalent of 1:1 mode, not sure about the exact name but the image is centered and black bars around it is what I meant) and it will still look blurry.

I believe that the native resolution of this display is `1024x768`, filled to 16:9. which might explain why the image is sharp there, but blurry at any resolution greater than this.

So in short, save your money and don't get a plasma TV. even a CRT is better than this.
